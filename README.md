* As a Black resident of the Seattle metropolitan area, I want to be able to add to an online resource of black-owned businesses in order to spread the word when I find a worthy business.
* As a Black resident of the Seattle metropolitan Seattle area, I want to be able to easily collaborate with other individuals seeking to support black-owned businesses because being able to utilize many experiences is better than one personâ€™s.
